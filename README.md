File 1 - AirlineDataAnalysis-R-Programming-Basic-Statistics

# Load the csv file with airlines data
# (a) Check the skewness of Distance travelled by airlines.
# (b) Calculate the mean, median and quantiles of the distance travelled by US Airlines (US).
# (c) Check the standard deviation of distance travelled by American Airlines (AA).
# (d) Draw a boxplot of UniqueCarrier with Distance.
# (e) Draw the direction of relationship between ArrDelay and DepDelay by drawing a scatterplot.


File 2 - AirlineDataAnalysis-R-Programming-Probability

# Load the csv file with airlines data
# (a)	What is the probability that a flight which is landing/taking off is "WN" Airlines (marginal probability)
# (b)	What is the probability that a flight which is landing/taking off is either "WN" or "AA" Airlines (disjoint events)
# (c)	What is the joint probability that a flight is both "WN" and travels less than 600 miles (joint probability)
# (d)	What is the conditional probability that the flight travels less than 2500 miles given that the flight is "AA" Airlines (conditional probability)
# (e)	What is the joint probability of a flight getting cancelled and is supposed to travel less than 2500 miles given that the flight is "AA" Airlines (joint + conditional probability)

File 3 - AirlineDataAnalysis-R-Programming-Distribution

# Calculate probability of normal distribution
# Calculate distributed binomial
# (a)	Suppose arrival delays of flights belonging to "AA" are normally distributed with mean 15 minutes and standard deviation 3 minutes. 
#     If the "AA" plans to announce a scheme where it will give 50% cash back if their flights are delayed by 20 minutes, 
#     how much percentage of the trips "AA" is supposed to loose this money. (Hint: pnorm)
# (b)	Assume that 65% of flights are diverted due to bad weather through the Weather System. 
#     What is the probability that in a random sample of 10 flights, 6 are diverted through the Weather System. (Hint: dbinorm)
# (c)	Do linear regression between the Arrival Delay and Departure Delay of the flights.
# (d)	Find out the confidence interval of the fitted linear regression line.
# (e)	Perform a multiple linear regression between the Arrival Delay along with the Departure Delay and Distance travelled by flights.
